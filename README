Steps to run this program:

1) Create a mysql database named crawlerdb
2) Import crawlerdb.sql into mysql
3) Edit db.properties to reflect your database connection
4) Open Main.java then run.


Steps to configure:

1) twitter4j.properties is where you enter your key values to allow you to run your app with
twitter... already done for this demo.
2) edit db.properties to configure the db.

Running the program:

There are three console menus. The first one is the main menu. From there, you can
access the other two, TwitterMenu, or InstagramMenu. Also on the main menu, you can run a report.

If you run the TwitterMenu, then...
- Option one will generate a list of approx. top ten hashtags used. I say approx. because
the twitter API says ten, but sometimes it is less and I think I have seen it be more.
- Option two will display the top hashtag out of the list returned, and then search posts for it.
- Option three will use the list of approx. ten items returned in step 1, and search Instagram.
Instagram will return the volume of hastag for the specific terms searched, but it will also return
alternate uses of the term, example - if you search for willy, you will get willywonka, 
or willynilly, or freewilly along with volume.

If you run InstagramMenu....
- Option one, you will specify a tag to search for. It will return alternate tags as mentioned 
above.
- Option two will show the volume of each tag returned.
- No need to worry about option three.
